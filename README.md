This repository contains example scripts to solve the 
variable Elasticity and Laplace operator equations 
using spectral methods. The resulting system of equations
is preconditioned by a constant coefficient approximation 
of the operator.

Both solvers read in a BrainGeometry matlab file which 
describes the spatial variability of physical coefficients 
in a realistic brain geometery.
